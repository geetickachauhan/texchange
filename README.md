# Texchange

This is an open source website which allows users to buy and sell textbooks. This project is currently being built for CEN 4010, a Software Engineering course offered by Florida International University. 

## Project summary
Texchange, will allow university students to buy and sell used textbooks. Users will be able to look up the textbook by its title or author, see various prices available from different sellers, and purchase the one they desire. Conversely, they will also be able to list their own book for sale so other users can purchase it. There will be three overall levels of user groups:

 - The first group will be known as Guests, which will be able to visit the website and browse through all the listings of books being sold.

- Registered Users will be the second group, which will be able to browse like a Guest, but are also able to purchase/sell books and have a public profile as well as report other users. They will have to have to verify their email before they can use any of the privileges offered to Registered Users.

- Finally, Administrators will be able to remove listings, users, and feature listings. Additionally, they will be able to ban users who receive too many reports.
